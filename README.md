# MetaKGSL introduction	

â€‹The semantic information of entity text in genetic knowledge graph data is very important. However, conventional GCN and GAT algorithms mainly learn the association information between entities in the knowledge graph, ignoring the semantic information of the relationship itself and the semantic information fo each entity. To address this limitation, this method uses a multi-head attention algorithm to complete the learning of triplet vectors, effectively integrating multi-hop relationships and neighboring entity information, and retaining the initial entity semantic vector at the end to prevent the loss of entity characteristics caused by overly complex graphs.
